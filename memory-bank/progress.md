# Progress

*Derives from [activeContext.md](./activeContext.md). What works, what’s left, and current status.*

## What Works
- **Repository:** Initialized and pushed to GitHub (`tornari2/Treasury_Take_Home`), branch `main`.
- **Task Master:** Initialized; config, state, and Cursor commands (`.cursor/commands/tm/`) in place.
- **Memory Bank:** All six core files created under `memory-bank/` with initial structure and cross-references.
- **Project rules:** `.cursor/rules/` contains Task Master and cursor rules (e.g. `taskmaster.mdc`, `dev_workflow.mdc`).
- **Env / ignore:** `.env.example` and `.gitignore` present.

## What’s Left to Build
- Product scope and PRD (or equivalent requirements document).
- Parsed Task Master tasks (from PRD or manual task creation).
- Application or deliverable implementation (stack TBD).
- Tests, docs, and any deployment or runbook steps (as required by scope).

## Current Status
- **Phase:** Bootstrap complete; ready for scope definition and first development tasks.
- **Blockers:** None identified; awaiting scope/PRD to drive task breakdown.

## Known Issues
- _None yet. Log here when bugs, tech debt, or environment issues are discovered._

---
*Update after meaningful progress, before/after major features, and on **update memory bank**. Keep in sync with activeContext.md.*
